# LungCancer_Stage_Detection_using_CTscan_images
In this repository, I have used python with tensorflow (Keras) to train my deep learning model with the 1000 images in a dataset in collab notebook. 

The ACCURACY of this MODEL is FOUND TO BE 84.76% 

I have used a dataset of 1000 images of CTscan images imported from Kaggle. all thanks to user https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/chest-ctscan-images.

This repository is the working project or mini_project to showcase my machine learning skills.
The model is save as lung_cancer_model.keras to used by other users.

All the 1000 image are divided into 3 folder:
  1. train (for training)
  2. test (for testing)
  3. valid (for accuracy)

Each of these folder includes 4 more folder:
  1. adenocarcinoma
  2. large.cell.carcinoma
  3. normal
  4. squamous.cell.carcinoma
